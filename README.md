# Efficient Transport - Graphs


Using Dijkstra as min-path algorithm in this project we used an ideia of a container with maximum nine positions and given a start and final configuration we want to stablish the mininmun changes between each position of the container.

This project is part of PAA class at Departamento de Ciência da Computação - UFMG.
